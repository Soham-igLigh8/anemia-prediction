Welcome to the **Anemia Prediction Model**â€”a cutting-edge tool leveraging deep learning to predict anemia with near-perfect accuracy. Trained on a robust dataset and powered by PyTorch, this model achieves a remarkable **98.95% accuracy**, making it a reliable companion for medical diagnostics. Curious about how AI can transform healthcare? Dive in!

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 98.95% on a balanced test set (285 samples).
- **Flexible Input**: Predicts anemia from single samples or batches of data.
- **Real-World Ready**: Uses 7 key features: Gender, Hemoglobin, MCH, MCHC, MCV, Age, and Iron Levels.
- **Easy Deployment**: Load and predict with a single script in Google Colab or any Python environment.

## ðŸ“Š How It Works
This model is a PyTorch neural network trained on a dataset of 1421 samples (801 non-anemic, 620 anemic), balanced with SMOTE for optimal performance. It uses a 3-layer architecture (64-32-1) to classify individuals as "Anemic" or "Not Anemic" based on blood metrics and demographic data. The result? A tool thatâ€™s both precise and practical.

### Sample Prediction
Input: `[1, 11.5, 22.0, 30.0, 85.0, 30, 10.0]`  
Output: `"Anemic"`
